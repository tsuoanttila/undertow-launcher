# Developer Guide

## Getting started

Here is a simple example on how to try out the add-on:

```
public class MyUI extends UI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UndertowLauncher.withUI(MyUI.class).run();
    }

    /* Rest of UI code */
```

This will start the Undertow servlet container serving the given UI in port `8080`.

To use as part of a TestBench test:

```
public class MyTestClass extends TestBenchTestCase {
    @ClassRule
    public static UndertowRule serverRule = UndertowRule.withUI(MyUI.class);
    
    @Before
    public void openUrl() {
        getDriver().get(serverRule.getServer().getBaseUrl());
    }
    
    /* Test methods */
}
```

This will start a server in random port in range `[50000, 60000)` and execute the test.
Server will shut down after the all test methods in class have run.
